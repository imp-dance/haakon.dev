            <p>
              I started working as a frontend developer for Idean in April of
              2020. Since then I've been able to take part in a couple of
              projects, namely the CityforCity initiative - as well as an
              internal Equinor project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working at Idean has been my first official web developer
              position, and has allowed me to work with larger teams of other
              developers and designers, which has greatly accelerated my growth
              and learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have worked using the scrum framework at a project at Equinor,
              which has been a great experience.

              I worked for LIGL AS for 4 years, from August 2016 - April 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time at LIGL I worked with a great range of tasks
              ranging from office IT-support to web development and legal tech
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              While working at LIGL, I learned how to use ContractExpress Author
              to automate legal documents. I also designed a website that
              interacts with these documents, complete with a login system,
              rating system, backend statistics, rating and sorting, and much
              more. This website came in many iterations, but the final version
              which is still up today is called{" "}
              <ExternalLink to="https://ida.ligl.no">Ida by LIGL</ExternalLink>.
              .
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than these projects, I've also developed and designed their
              website, <ExternalLink to="https://ligl.no">ligl.no</ExternalLink>
              . I mostly made this in PHP, as the project was started before I
              really had much experience with Javascript frameworks.

            Ida by LIGL was a project I worked on at LIGL and that I still
            maintain today. Ida is a tool for anyone to generate top quality
            legal documents. I worked on both the document automation part
            (using ContractExpress Author) as well as our web portal for free
