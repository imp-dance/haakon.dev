              I started working as a frontend developer for Idean in April of
              2020. Since then I've been able to take part in a couple of
              projects, namely the CityforCity initiative - as well as an
              internal Equinor project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working at Idean has been my first official web developer
              position, and has allowed me to work with larger teams of other
              developers and designers, which has greatly accelerated my growth
              and learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              We usually have <i>frontend friday</i> every week, where me and
              the other frontenders discuss and share news and interesting
              things related to frontend that we've picked up over the week. We
              also sometimes do presentations for eachother on various subjects,
              to teach and reflect.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my projects at Idean has been developing the frontend for
              the <Link to="#/cityforcity">City for City</Link> initiative. The
              websites were developed using Gatsby and Strapi, and were
              published October 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've also been involved in an internal project at Equinor, which
              was my first large-scale Typescript+React project. I worked on
              developing and implementing a few new features, as well as fixing
              bugs and testing. We used the agile SCRUM methodology, which I
              really enjoyed working with.

              I worked for LIGL AS for 4 years, from August 2016 - April 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time at LIGL I worked with a great range of tasks
              ranging from office IT-support to web development and legal tech
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              While working at LIGL, I learned how to use ContractExpress Author
              to automate legal documents. I also designed a website that
              interacts with these documents, complete with a login system,
              rating system, backend statistics, rating and sorting, and much
              more. This website came in many iterations, but the final version
              which is still up today is called{" "}

              I have also developed and designed their website,{" "}
              <ExternalLink to="https://ligl.no">ligl.no</ExternalLink>. This
              project was started prior to me having much experience with
              Javascript frameworks, so it was made using PHP, HTML, CSS and
              jQuery.

            <p>
              CityforCity was started on a voluntary basis at Idean Bergen. The
              initiative was a website where small local businesses that had
              been affected by and/or made concrete changes to their operation
              because of the covid pandemic are promoted to their local
              community.
            </p>
            <p>
              The original websites for Bergen, Stavanger and Oslo were all
              built and hosted at Squarespace, but this soon showed itself to be
              very limiting when the ambitions of the project grew. Squarespace
              was generally bad at handling articles and categorisation and it
              was difficult to implement more complex features. Because of this,
              we decided to develop our own custom system.
            </p>
            <p>
              My role in this project was sketching out and developing the new
              system. I decided to go for GatsbyJS for static rendering, and
              Strapi as a CMS system. After setting up the core functionality, I
              developed the frontend design based on an Adobe XD sketch created
              by a UX designer at Idean.

              Ida by LIGL was a project I worked on for several years while
              employed at LIGL AS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ida is a tool for anyone to generate top quality legal documents.
              I worked on both the document automation part (using
              ContractExpress Author) as well as developing and designing our
              web portal for free users (Ida by LIGL)
            </p>
            <p>
              Ida by LIGL is made using React and SCSS on the frontend, and PHP
              on the backend.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was (and am) the only developer that's worked on this project,
              and it was a great learning experience for me regarding the
              importance of writing maintainable code bases, as well as
              developing my skills with React, accessibility, user experience
              and design.

              This was my first project using a modern Javascript framework,
